                - The **last question** must be: "Do you have any queries?"

                - The **final 2 questions ignoring the default last question (last minute)** should be **HR/behavioural if the duration is greater than or equal 5 minutes**
                - Tailor questions based on:
                - Round type (warm-up, role-related, technical)
                - Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, professional, expert)
                - Out of all question leaving the first and last question make sure 50% are resume based and 50% are {job} based questions
                - Ensure **90% of questions are not repeated** from the last few interviews for this role
